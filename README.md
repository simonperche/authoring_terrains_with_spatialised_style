# Authoring Terrains with Spatialised Style 

## Abstract
Various terrain modeling methods have been proposed for the past few decades, providing efficient and often interactive authoring tools. However, they seldom include any notion of style, which is a critical aspect for designers in the entertainment industry. We introduce a new generative network method that bridges the gap between automatic terrain synthesis and authoring, providing a versatile set of authoring tools allowing spatialized style. Given an input sketch or existing elevation map, our method generates a terrain with features that can be authored, enhanced, and augmented using interactive brushes and style manipulation tools. The strength of our approach resides in the versatility and interoperability of the toolbox.
